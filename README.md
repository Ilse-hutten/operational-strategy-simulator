# Operational Strategy Simulator

A Streamlit app to simulate and optimize strategic initiatives based on cost, engineering constraints, and ARR/ROI impact. It enables users to select initiatives manually or use an automated knapsack-based optimizer, and visualize expected ROI distributions under uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulations.

## Features

-  **Interactive budget and engineering constraints**
-  **Manual selection of initiatives with performance metrics**
-  **Optimized selection via linear programming (ARR or ROI)**
-  **Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate risk-adjusted ROI**
-  **Scenario modeling (Good / Neutral / Bad)**
-  **Clean UI with professional layout and summaries**

### Optimization Logic

- Each initiative is treated as a **binary decision**:
  - `1` = selected  
  - `0` = not selected

- The model **maximizes** either:
  - **ARR Impact** â†’ total expected ARR from selected initiatives
  - **ROI (Net Gain)** â†’ total ARR minus total cost from selected initiatives

- **Objective functions**:
  - Maximize ARR:â€ƒsum of `(ARR Impact Ã— selected)` across initiatives
  - Maximize ROI:â€ƒsum of `((ARR Impact - Cost) Ã— selected)` across initiatives

- **Subject to constraints**:
  - Total **cost** of selected initiatives â‰¤ available **budget**
  - Total **engineering days** required â‰¤ available **engineering capacity**

- Solved using a **binary knapsack optimization** model via `pulp`
